## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Nuxt 3 / Vue 3 (Composition API) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **State:** Pinia (actions only, no direct mutations from components)
- **Forms:** vee-validate + zod

## Discovery Mode

**Trigger:** User says "build me...", "I want...", "create...", "make me..." AND project is greenfield (`[APP_NAME]` placeholder still present in CLAUDE.md or no migrations exist).

**Round 1 — Big Picture (4 questions via AskUserQuestion with clickable options):**
- "What kind of app is this closest to?" (dashboard / submission tool / communication tool / scheduling tool / **mobile app** / other)
- "Who will use this?" (just me / my team / team + external people)
- "Do you need a mobile app (iOS/Android)?" (yes — mobile + web / web only / mobile only)
- "Which backend language?" (Python — FastAPI / C# — ASP.NET Core)

*Mobile answer writes `INCLUDE_MOBILE=true` to `.env`; backend answer writes `BACKEND_LANGUAGE=python` or `BACKEND_LANGUAGE=csharp` to `.env`. Bootstrap reads these on next run.*

**Round 2 — Core Features (challenge round, 1-2 questions):**
- Present feature options as multi-select based on Round 1
- Challenge: "Is there anything I'm missing? Any approval workflows or external system connections?"

**Round 3 — Data & Access (1 question):**
- "Should everyone see everything, or only their own stuff?" (everyone / own only / role-based)

**Skip condition:** If initial request has 3+ features AND mentions audience, generate brief directly.

**Output:** Write `.claude/brief.md` with: app name, description, users, features, data model sketch, access rules, out-of-scope. Update `[APP_NAME]` in CLAUDE.md, write `build` to `.claude/mode`, narrate plan, ask "Does this look right?"

## Build Mode

Default mode. Write correct code automatically, narrate in plain English.

**Auto-include:** Loading/error/empty states in Vue components, rate limiting + pagination + soft deletes + auth guards in Python/C# routes, RLS + standard columns + FK indexes in migrations, tests alongside implementation. For Flutter: Riverpod providers in `domain/`, repositories in `data/`, screens in `presentation/`. Narrate each in one sentence.

**Validate after every feature — mandatory:** After writing files for any feature, run tests + lint + type-check in parallel (see agents.md). Fix every failure before responding. Never hand back code that doesn't pass. The user should never see a broken state.

**Language:** No tool names, no sub-agent mentions, no "Missing X" — say "I added...". Plain English, one sentence per fix.

**Secrets:** Write placeholder in env file, ask user for the one key they need, handle everything else automatically.

**After features:** Run `supabase db push` if migration created. Fix env vars yourself. Start servers if needed. End with one plain-English line. Never give "Next steps" blocks.

**Blocks:** Hardcoded secrets, service role key in frontend, direct Supabase calls outside services/ (web) or features/*/data/ (mobile), raw SQL string concatenation in C#, business logic in C# route handlers.

## Deploy Mode

Trigger: "ship it", "deploy", "go live". Write `deploy` to `.claude/mode`.

1. **If `DEPLOY_TARGET` is not set in `.env`:** Ask (AskUserQuestion) "Where do you want to put the app?" with options: "On the company server" / "In the cloud". Set `DEPLOY_TARGET=azure` or `DEPLOY_TARGET=vercel` in `.env` — this setting sticks until changed.
2. Ask up to 2 more questions via AskUserQuestion with clickable options to determine gate level (mvp/team/production).
3. Run `bash .claude/scripts/run-pipeline.sh <gate>` (reads `DEPLOY_TARGET` from env).
4. Write `build` back to `.claude/mode` when done.

**Language rule:** Say "company server" when referring to Azure. Say "cloud" when referring to Vercel. Never say the technical names in conversation. Say "switch to the company server" / "switch to the cloud" for target changes.

**Switch anytime:** If the manager says "switch to the company server" or "switch to the cloud", update `DEPLOY_TARGET` in `.env` and confirm in plain English.

## Cloud Deploy Mode

Trigger: "deploy to cloud", "make this live", "put it online", "go live" (when context implies cloud deployment, not local).

**Skip condition:** If `DEPLOY_TARGET` is already set → skip target discovery, go straight to the appropriate path.

### Path A — Cloud (Vercel)

**Skip condition:** If `vercel.json` exists AND `deploy-state.json` shows previous cloud deploy → skip discovery, go straight to deploy.

**Discovery (AskUserQuestion):**
- Round 1: "Do you have a Vercel account?" (Yes / No / IT handles this) + "Do you have a Supabase Cloud project?" (Yes / No / Not sure)
- Round 2: "Where should this go?" (Staging / Production)

**Three paths:**
1. **Self-service** (has accounts): `scaffold-cloud-configs.sh` → `run-pipeline.sh` → `deploy-cloud.sh`
2. **IT handoff** (IT handles infra): `scaffold-cloud-configs.sh` → `generate-handoff-doc.sh` → narrate "I created a setup guide for your IT team"
3. **Guided setup** (unsure): `generate-handoff-doc.sh` → `scaffold-cloud-configs.sh` → narrate what they need

**Architecture:** Frontend (Nuxt 3 SSR) + Backend (FastAPI serverless) both deploy to Vercel. Database on Supabase Cloud.

### Path B — Company Server (Azure)

**Skip condition:** If `azure-container-app.yml` exists AND `deploy-state.json` shows previous azure deploy → skip discovery, go straight to deploy.

**Discovery (AskUserQuestion):**
- Round 1: "Does your IT team have Azure set up?" (Yes / No / Not sure) + "Do you have a Google Workspace account for company login?" (Yes / No)
- Round 2: "Where should this go?" (Staging / Production)

**Three paths:**
1. **Self-service** (IT has Azure): `scaffold-azure-configs.sh` → `run-pipeline.sh` (DEPLOY_TARGET=azure) → `deploy-azure.sh`
2. **IT handoff** (IT handles infra): `scaffold-azure-configs.sh` → `generate-azure-handoff-doc.sh` → narrate "I created a setup guide for your IT team"
3. **Guided setup** (unsure): `generate-azure-handoff-doc.sh` → `scaffold-azure-configs.sh` → narrate what they need

**Architecture:** App runs as a Docker container on Azure Container Apps. Google SSO is handled automatically — employees log in with their company email. Database isolated per app via `APP_SCHEMA`.

## Architectural Rules

- Service role key (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) stays in backend only — auto-switch to anon key in frontend.

*All other rules (service layer, Pinia, RLS, query builder, etc.) are in the other files in this directory.*

## Sub-Agent Workflow

See `.claude/rules/agents.md` for full guidance. Never mention agents to the user.

## Session Lifecycle

On session start, check `.claude/session/latest.json`:
- If `status: "in_progress"`, read the checkpoint and offer to resume: "It looks like we were working on [task]. Want to pick up where we left off?"
- If `latest.json` is missing but `.claude/session/file-log.txt` is non-empty, infer crash — read file log + `git status` and offer recovery.

Progress tracking: Write `.claude/session/plan.md` with checkboxes for multi-step tasks. On resume, check file existence and box state.

## Definition of Done

- User says it works
- Deploy pipeline passes at chosen gate level
- No security issues
