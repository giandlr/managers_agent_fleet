# Managers' Agent Fleet

**Build enterprise apps by describing what you want in plain English.** Quality, security, and testing happen automatically behind the scenes.

This toolkit turns [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) into a full engineering team for non-technical managers. You describe features in natural language, Claude builds production-quality code, and an automated pipeline ensures everything works before you share it.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create a new project and initialize git
mkdir my-app && cd my-app && git init

# 2. Copy the toolkit zip and unzip it (creates managers-agent-fleet/ folder)
cp /path/to/managers-agent-fleet.zip .
unzip managers-agent-fleet.zip

# 3. Install the toolkit (copies files, sets up .gitignore, cleans up)
bash managers-agent-fleet/install.sh

# 4. Bootstrap your app (scaffolds everything + starts the servers)
bash scripts/sprout-bootstrap.sh

# 5. Open CLAUDE.md and replace [APP_NAME] with your app's name

# 6. Open Claude Code and start building
claude
```

After bootstrap completes, your app is already running:

| Service         | URL                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Frontend        | http://localhost:3000         |
| Backend API     | http://localhost:8000         |
| API Docs        | http://localhost:8000/docs    |
| Supabase Studio | http://localhost:54323        |

A development user (`dev@sprout.local` / `devpassword123`) is seeded automatically for local testing.

> **Note:** Toolkit files are automatically excluded from git. When you commit or deploy, only your project's source code is included — never the fleet infrastructure.

## How It Works

### Three Phases

| Phase | When | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Discovery** | New project, first conversation | Claude asks 2-3 rounds of clickable questions to understand what you want, then writes a project brief for your approval before building. |
| **Build** (default) | You're creating features | Build freely. Only security issues are blocked. Claude auto-fixes quality and explains what it did in plain English. |
| **Deploy** | You say "ship it" | Claude asks who it's for and runs the appropriate level of checks before sharing. |

### Three Deploy Levels

| Level | Who It's For | What's Checked |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **MVP** | Just you testing | Security scan, app starts, happy path works |
| **Team** | Sharing with colleagues | + Unit tests pass, auth works, errors handled |
| **Production** | External users | + Full test suite, performance, independent Opus code review |

Start at MVP and graduate to Production as your project matures.

### Session Recovery

If your terminal closes or crashes, Claude automatically saves a checkpoint. When you reopen Claude Code, it offers to pick up where you left off — no work is lost.

## Tech Stack

The toolkit scaffolds projects with:

- **Frontend:** Nuxt 3 / Vue 3 (Composition API) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **State:** Pinia
- **Forms:** vee-validate + zod
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.9+, async)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (JWT) + RBAC (4 default roles)
- **Testing:** Vitest + Playwright (frontend), pytest (backend)
- **Quality:** ESLint, Prettier, vue-tsc, ruff, mypy, bandit
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend SSR + backend serverless) + Supabase Cloud

All technology decisions are defined in `docs/tech-stack.md`.

---

## The Bootstrap Script

`scripts/sprout-bootstrap.sh` takes you from an empty project to a running app in one command:

| Phase | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Scaffold** | Creates Nuxt 3 frontend, FastAPI backend, and Supabase directory structure |
| **2. Configure** | Installs all dependencies, creates config files, sets up dev plugins |
| **3. Supabase** | Initializes and starts local Supabase, extracts credentials, seeds a dev user |
| **4. Start** | Launches backend and frontend dev servers |
| **5. Dev Tools** | Installs gitleaks, k6, and sets file permissions |

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (18+)
- **Python** (3.9+)
- **Docker** (for local Supabase)

Docker is optional during build mode — the app works as a UI shell without a database, showing empty states and an informational banner. Supabase is required at the Team and Production deploy levels.

---

## Protection Layers

### Layer 1 — Rules
Claude automatically follows project standards for API design, authentication, database patterns, and frontend conventions. Defined in `.claude/rules/`.

### Layer 2 — Guards (Hooks)
Real-time checks on every code write and command execution. Block messages are two-part: what was blocked AND what Claude will do instead.
- **Always blocked:** Hardcoded secrets, dangerous commands, admin keys in frontend, SQL injection, eval()
- **Build mode warnings (deploy blocks):** Unsafe CORS, missing RLS, unindexed foreign keys, console.log, missing error handling, unbounded queries

### Layer 3 — Specialist Agents
Parallel AI workers for tests, security scans, and performance checks. The pipeline orchestrator coordinates them without touching code itself.

### Layer 4 — Pipeline
Gate-level validation when you deploy. The pipeline accepts a gate level (`mvp`, `team`, `production`) and runs only the stages required for that level.

### Layer 5 — Opus Review (Production only)
An independent AI reviewer (Claude Opus) examines the code with zero knowledge of the development session. Like an external auditor. Runs with a 5-minute timeout.

## Key Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Start frontend | `cd frontend && npm run dev` |
| Start backend | `cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload` |
| Run backend tests | `cd backend && pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing` |
| Run frontend tests | `cd frontend && npm run test` |
| Run e2e tests | `cd frontend && npx playwright test` |
| Lint backend | `cd backend && ruff check . && mypy .` |

---

## Cloud Deployment

The toolkit supports deploying to Vercel (frontend + backend) with Supabase Cloud:

```
Vercel (single platform)
├── Nuxt 3 SSR (frontend/)
└── FastAPI Serverless (api/index.py wraps backend/)

Supabase Cloud
└── PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Realtime
```

**Three deployment paths:**
- **Self-service:** You have Vercel + Supabase accounts → scaffold configs → pipeline → deploy
- **IT handoff:** Your IT team handles infrastructure → auto-generated setup guide
- **Guided setup:** Not sure → full handoff doc + configs ready for when you are

Say "deploy to cloud" or "make this live" to start. Estimated cloud costs: Vercel Pro ~$20/mo, Supabase Pro ~$25/mo.

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `bash .claude/scripts/scaffold-cloud-configs.sh` | Creates vercel.json, API adapter, CORS config |
| `bash .claude/scripts/deploy-cloud.sh [staging\|production]` | Deploys to Vercel |
| `bash .claude/scripts/setup-supabase-cloud.sh <ref>` | Links + pushes to Supabase Cloud |
| `bash .claude/scripts/generate-handoff-doc.sh` | Creates IT setup guide |

---

## Playwright E2E Testing

Bootstrap automatically installs Playwright (chromium-only) and creates starter test patterns:

- **`tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts`** — Login flow, auth redirect, session handling
- **`tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`** — Page load + accessibility checks (axe-core)
- **`tests/e2e/forms.spec.ts`** — Form validation patterns

Tests run as part of the pipeline at Team+ gate levels. Claude adapts the starter patterns to your actual app during build.

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `cd frontend && npm run test:e2e` | Run e2e tests |
| `cd frontend && npm run test:e2e:ui` | Run with interactive UI |

---

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Bootstrap creates a complete RBAC foundation with 4 default roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Admin** | Full access to all resources |
| **Manager** | Manage team members and resources |
| **Member** | View and edit own resources |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access |

The dev user (`dev@sprout.local`) is automatically assigned the admin role. Claude adds app-specific RLS policies and role-aware features during build.

**Backend:** `require_role("admin")` FastAPI dependency for protected endpoints.
**Frontend:** `useRole()` composable for role-aware UI rendering.

## Philosophy

> "The best engineering practices shouldn't require an engineering degree."

- **Discover first** — Before building, Claude asks the right questions to understand what you want.
- **Build freely** — Your creative flow is sacred. Quality enforcement stays out of your way during development.
- **Deploy safely** — When you're ready to share, the right level of checks activates automatically.
- **Plain English always** — Claude never mentions tool names or technical jargon. It explains what it did and why in language anyone can understand.
- **Progressive gates** — Start simple with MVP, graduate to Production when ready. The system grows with you.
- **Nothing lost** — Session checkpoints mean crashes and terminal closes don't cost you progress.
