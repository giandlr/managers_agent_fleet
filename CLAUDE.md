## Project: [APP_NAME]

[One-sentence description of what this application does and who it serves.]

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Nuxt 3 / Vue 3 (Composition API) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **State:** Pinia (actions only, no direct mutations from components)
- **Forms:** vee-validate + zod
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.9+, async)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, RLS enforced on all tables)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (JWT, server-side verification)
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage (bucket RLS, signed URLs < 1hr)
- **Realtime:** Supabase Realtime channels

## Directory Structure

- `frontend/components/` — Vue components (composition API, < 200 lines)
- `frontend/composables/` — Shared composables (Realtime subscriptions here)
- `frontend/pages/` — Nuxt file-based routing
- `frontend/stores/` — Pinia stores (< 150 lines, split by domain)
- `frontend/services/` — ALL Supabase client calls — components never call Supabase directly
- `frontend/types/` — Shared TypeScript types
- `frontend/tests/` — Vitest + Playwright tests
- `backend/routes/` — FastAPI routers (no business logic, < 20 lines per handler)
- `backend/services/` — Business logic layer
- `backend/models/` — Pydantic request/response models
- `backend/middleware/` — Auth, logging, error handling, CORS
- `backend/tests/` — pytest suites
- `supabase/migrations/` — SQL migrations (`supabase db diff`)
- `supabase/functions/` — Edge Functions (Deno)

## Commands

- **Bootstrap:** `bash scripts/sprout-bootstrap.sh`
- **Dev frontend:** `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- **Dev backend:** `cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload`
- **Test backend:** `cd backend && pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing`
- **Test frontend:** `cd frontend && npm run test`
- **Test e2e:** `cd frontend && npx playwright test`
- **Lint backend:** `cd backend && ruff check . && mypy .`
- **Lint frontend:** `cd frontend && npm run lint`
- **Type check frontend:** `cd frontend && vue-tsc --noEmit`
- **Migrate:** `supabase db push`
- **New migration:** `supabase db diff -f [migration_name]`

## Discovery Mode

**Trigger:** User says "build me...", "I want...", "create...", "make me..." AND project is greenfield (`[APP_NAME]` placeholder still present or no migrations exist).

**Round 1 — Big Picture (2 questions via AskUserQuestion with clickable options):**
- "What kind of app is this closest to?" (dashboard / submission tool / communication tool / scheduling tool / other)
- "Who will use this?" (just me / my team / team + external people)

**Round 2 — Core Features (challenge round, 1-2 questions):**
- Present feature options as multi-select based on Round 1
- Challenge: "Is there anything I'm missing? Any approval workflows or external system connections?"

**Round 3 — Data & Access (1 question):**
- "Should everyone see everything, or only their own stuff?" (everyone / own only / role-based)

**Skip condition:** If initial request has 3+ features AND mentions audience, generate brief directly.

**Output:** Write `.claude/brief.md` with: app name, description, users, features, data model sketch, access rules, out-of-scope. Update `[APP_NAME]` in this file, write `build` to `.claude/mode`, narrate plan, ask "Does this look right?"

## Build Mode

Default mode. Write correct code automatically, narrate in plain English.

**Auto-include:** Loading/error/empty states in Vue components, rate limiting + pagination + soft deletes + auth guards in Python routes, RLS + standard columns + FK indexes in migrations, tests alongside implementation. Narrate each in one sentence.

**Language:** No tool names, no sub-agent mentions, no "Missing X" — say "I added...". Plain English, one sentence per fix.

**Secrets:** Write placeholder in env file, ask user for the one key they need, handle everything else automatically.

**After features:** Run `supabase db push` if migration created. Fix env vars yourself. Start servers if needed. End with one plain-English line. Never give "Next steps" blocks.

**Blocks:** Hardcoded secrets, service role key in frontend, direct Supabase calls outside services/.

## Deploy Mode

Trigger: "ship it", "deploy", "go live". Write `deploy` to `.claude/mode`. Ask up to 3 questions via AskUserQuestion with clickable options to determine gate level (mvp/team/production). Run `bash .claude/scripts/run-pipeline.sh <gate>`. Write `build` back to `.claude/mode` when done.

## Architectural Rules

- Service role key (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) stays in backend only — auto-switch to anon key in frontend.

*All other rules (service layer, Pinia, RLS, query builder, etc.) are in `.claude/rules/`.*

## Sub-Agent Workflow

See `.claude/rules/agents.md` for full guidance. Never mention agents to the user.

## Session Lifecycle

On session start, check `.claude/session/latest.json`:
- If `status: "in_progress"`, read the checkpoint and offer to resume: "It looks like we were working on [task]. Want to pick up where we left off?"
- If `latest.json` is missing but `.claude/session/file-log.txt` is non-empty, infer crash — read file log + `git status` and offer recovery.

Progress tracking: Write `.claude/session/plan.md` with checkboxes for multi-step tasks. On resume, check file existence and box state.

## Definition of Done

- User says it works
- Deploy pipeline passes at chosen gate level
- No security issues
